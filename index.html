				<p>If you're here, then chances are you're looking to get something done. Whether that something is a new logo or brand for your business, a swanky new website, some illustration work, or simply a well laid-out brochure, you can now safely relax and stop looking.</p>
				<p>I love design, I love illustration, and it's my mission in life to make the world a little more beautiful, one business at a time. Whether you want to completely re-invent your image from the ground up, or you just need some nice signage to draw in that extra little bit business, my job is to make sure that you're completely satisfied with the end result.</p>

						<h3>GRAPHIC DESIGN</h3>
						<p>The services I offer in the realm of Graphic Design can help you and your business reach the next level, and draw in additional customers through attractive and intuitive visuals. Design is essential in today's world of constant visual stimulation, and it's important to set yourself apart from your competition with a strong and consistent brand.</p>

						<h3>ILLUSTRATION</h3>
						<p>In addition to digital products, I also offer more traditional artistic services. Illustration can be anything from posters to concept art, character design, and traditional illustration for books and book covers. Multiple styles are offered, as well as both digital and traditional mediums.</p>

						<h3>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3>
						<p>The internet has grown up, and in this day and age everybody needs some form of online presence. But learning to build your own website takes time, and most online templates just aren't versatile enough. I design and code my websites from scratch, ensuring that every pixel is exactly where you want it.</p>
